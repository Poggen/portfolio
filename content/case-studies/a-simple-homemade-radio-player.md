### Overview

I wanted to create the simplest possible radio player possible for the most popular channels at Sveriges Radio.

<br />

### Insight

8 out of 10 users visiting the different digital products at Sveriges Radio immediately starts listening to a radio channel.

<br />

### Challenges

How do I make it as easy as possible for them to listen to a channel? And which technical solution should I use? Is there a way of using the real channels?

<br />

### Solution

I choosed to make the simples radio player possible, when you tap a icon of a channel the channel starts playing and when you tap again it stops playing. I wrote it in React, it runs on Netlify and Gatsby. I added a simple audio player as NPM package and created re-useable components for channel icons.
