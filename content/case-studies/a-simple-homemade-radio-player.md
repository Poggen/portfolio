### Overview

As a learning project I wanted to design and build my own radio player. The goal was to learn more about React, design tokens and API at Sveriges Radio.

<br />

### Challenges

Given my limited skills in React the biggest challenge was to design something that I actually could figure out how to build. Another challenge was using the API for live radio channels.

<br />

### Solution

I choose to make the simplest radio player possible. When you tap an icon of a channel the channel starts playing and when you tap again it stops playing. I created a re-usable component in code that is placed in a grid of four items, each instance of the component is configured with an unique channel logo and mp3 stream for audio.

<br />

### Learnings

I learned to find and install NPM packages that I hadn't done before. I also learned to create an re-usable component in React, its works the same as in Sketch where I designed it. Pretty neat! And I also learned how to use the open API at Sveriges Radio in order to connect the audio streams to the re-usable components.
