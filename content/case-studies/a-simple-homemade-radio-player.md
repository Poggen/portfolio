<br />

### Overview

I wanted to create the simplest possible radio player possible for the most popular channels at Sveriges Radio. The goal was to learn more about the open API at Sveriges Radio and to develop skills in React. 

<br />

### Insight

8 out of 10 users visiting Sveriges Radio app and site immediately starts listening to a radio channel.

<br />

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was to make it as easy as possible for the user to get started. Another challenge was my limited skills in React and using using a public API was something that I've never done before.

<br />

### Solution

I choose to make the simples radio player possible, when you tap an icon of a channel the channel starts playing and when you tap again it stops playing. I wrote it in React, it runs on Netlify and Gatsby. I added a simple audio player as NPM package and created re-useable components for channel icons.
