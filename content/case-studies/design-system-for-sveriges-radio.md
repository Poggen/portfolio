My role: Lead Product Designer

Client: [Sveriges Radio](https://sverigesradio.se)

Year: 2019 - 

<br />

### Overview

As a lead designer I've been working with design systems at Sveriges Radio since 2019. Creating a design language, setting up workflows and making sure all of the design is made to scale and work for just about every Swede from 8 to 65 years old.

<br />

### Challenges

Where does one even start with design systems in a big organisation? How do you get fellow designers to start working systematically? How do you convince stakeholders to give you resources and time to set up a team? How does components scale when your product covers smallest phone to biggest TV? And how do you keep all of this user-centered?

### Solution

At Sveriges Radio I started by spending three months doing research, interviewing and building a PoC. Then I set off as an ambassador for design systems, speaking to everyone even remotely working with design. I think the most important thing with design systems is that it starts being used, then you'll figure out all of the details.

As an ambassador I came with a component library in Storybook and all of the fundamentals as variables as an NPM package for developers to use. Fellow designers were onboarded when we designed together in Figma with components and styles. We created design principles and built prototypes for user testing among many activities.

### Learnings

The most important learning is that you can only convince people to start working with design systems if you sell them all of the advantages like speed, consistency and value for the user. To be user-centered is important and it's not only the end user when it comes to design systems, it's everyone from developers to designers to stakeholders. 

Design systems is a companies guide for building digital products.
