### Overview

As a lead designer I've been working with design systems for Sveriges Radio Play since 2019. Finding a design language, setting up workflows and making sure all of the design is made to scale and work for just about every Swede from 8 - 65 years old.

### Challenges

Starting to work with design systems poses many challenges, where does one even start in a big organisation? How do you get fellow designers to start working systematic? How do you convince stakeholders to give you resources and time to set up a team? How does components scale when your product is for smallest phone to biggest TV? And how do you keep all of this user centered?

</br>

### Solution

At Sveriges Radio I started by spending 3 months doing research, interviewing and building a small PoC. Then I set off as an ambassador for design systems, speaking to everyone even remotely touching design. The most important thing with design systems is that it starts being used as a tool internally. As an ambassador I came with a component library in Storybook and all of the fundamentals as variables as an NPM package for developers to use. Fellow designers onboarded by designing pages together in Figma with components and styles. We created design principles together and built protypes even with audio for user testing.

### Learnings

The most important learning is that you can only convince people to start working with design systems if you sell them all of the advantages like speed, consistency and value for the user. To be user centered is important and its not only the end user when it comes to design systems at Sveriges Radio, is everyone from developers to designers to stake holders.
