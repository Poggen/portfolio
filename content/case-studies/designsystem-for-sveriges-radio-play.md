**Overview**

In 2018/2019 I helped my friends at Grafikwerket with their work for Google Ventures. My part of the project was designing a brand new UI for GV.com.

**Challenge**\
\
To use the new look and feel created by brand design Viktor Persson and present GV and its portfolio companies. Each company is unique but how do you make them standout whilst presenting them on an equal level? And how do you include the new element "the slash"?

**Process**\
\
An new element in the branding was "the slash"

**Solution**\
\
Hej hej

**Result**\
\
Hej hej
