### Overview

In 2018-2019 I redesigned Google Ventures site GV.com. I did all of the UI-design based on branding by Viktor Persson at [Grafikwerket.](https://grafikwerket.com/) 

<br />

### Challenges

Presenting all of the portfolio companies with their branding while keeping the Google Ventures branding consistent across the site was one of the biggest challenges.

<br />

### Solution

The diagonal "slash" element was color coded for respective portfolio company and used as feature in the UI. There's re-usable components to present content across the site. Based on the grid from material design the components scales, pretty neat given the client invented material design. And the typography and spacing system is as well from material design.

<br />

### Learnings

Delivering a project across the globe was a first for me in this project. It was time saving for both me and developers to use grid, spacing and typography from a well established design system like material design. I also learned that color coding 50+ portfolio companies is a pretty daunting task.
