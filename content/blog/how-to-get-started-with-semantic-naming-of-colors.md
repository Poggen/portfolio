In this blog post I'll describe how to get started with semantic naming of colors and why it's a pretty sweet thing.

A great thing benefit with design systems is that you have one source of truth. That makes it easy to build new components with consistency. I'll show you how you can work with colors a little bit smarter so both you and your developers save time.

Here's my example design I'll use, as you can see its just a background with text and underline for now.

The text color is the first color in the foreground, so we name it "foreground/primary". Then we have the underline thats the second color so we name it "foreground/secondary. And then we also have a background color that we call "background/primary".

Here we have our color scheme in Figma, they are also added as color styles.
