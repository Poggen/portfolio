title: How to get started with semantic naming of colors
description: Design system

In this blog post I'll describe how to get started with semantic naming of colors and why it's a pretty sweet thing.\
\
For this site I'm using a slight off-white as a text color, it's the primary color in the foreground. So instead of using "--colors-white" or "#FFFFF5" I'm using "foreground/primary". Pretty simple, right? \
\
There's a few more colors I'm using for this site like link colors and background so let's add them as well.
