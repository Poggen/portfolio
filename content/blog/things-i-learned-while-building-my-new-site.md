title: Things I learned while building my new site

Welcome to my new site. As a designer interested in code I decided to try and build a site on my own this time. I'd like to share a few useful resources I used.

[Design+Code](https://designcode.io/)

I've been interested in React for quite a while and decided to take some courses by Meng Too at Design+Code. I find his courses easy to follow since he has a design background and most of the chapters is about building things that actually work.

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

Frontend framework that gives you a head start when building web. For this project I used a template that gave me a working start page and CMS, pretty sweet.

Then I wrote the frontend in React. Since it's styled with CSS and I used components based design it went rather fast. What took the most time was configuring the components to display the different GraphQL fields I needed.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

For building and deploying I used Netlify. [](https://www.netlify.com/)It's super simple to hook up your Github repo and you can build both master and branches. As a last step I configured my DNS settings for the domain so it pointed towards Netlify.

Thanks a lot [Oscar Hillestad](https://github.com/Poggen) and [Prakash](https://github.com/prakashdraws) for helping me out.
