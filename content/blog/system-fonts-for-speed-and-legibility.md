title: System fonts for speed and legibility

For my site I've used system fonts. It's pretty easy and the CSS looks like this: 

```
body {
  font-family: system-ui, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

</ br>

This is great for several reasons. 

1/ Fonts are not externally loaded, blazing fast

2/ It looks styled to the OS, it just kind of fits

3/ Always perfectly rendered
