Welcome to my new site. As a designer interested in code I decided to try and build a site on my own this time. I'd like to share a few useful resources I used. 

I jumped into React by taking courses by Meng Too at [Design+Code.](https://designcode.io/)

Gatsby its a popular boilerplate, it gives you a great start when you want to build web. For this site I used a template that gave me a CMS for my posts straight away. 

Then I just wrote all of the frontend in React. Since its mostly styled with CSS and I used components it went rather fast, using the simple principle of Atomic Design. What took the most time was configuring the components to display the different GraphQL fields I needed. Luckily I have some talented friends that helped me out when I got stuck!
