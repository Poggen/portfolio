Welcome to my new site. I decided to write in in React for two reasons that I'm going to outline:\
\
A/ I like challenges
B/ I didn't know anything about React\
\
I jumped into React by taking courses by Meng Too at [Design+Code.](https://designcode.io/) Meng is pedagogic and you build things out of a designers perspective, so I found it easy to follow.

Gatsby its a popular boilerplate, it gives you a great start when you want to build web. For this site I used a template that gave me a CMS for my posts straight away. 

Then I just wrote all of the frontend in React. Since its mostly styled with CSS and I used components it went rather fast, using the simple principle of Atomic Design. What took the most time was configuring the components to display the different GraphQL fields I needed. Luckily I have some talented friends that helped me out when I got stuck!
