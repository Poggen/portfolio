Welcome to my new site. As a designer interested in code I decided to try and build a site on my own this time. I'd like to share a few useful resources I used. 

I've been interested in React for quite a while and started off by taking courses by Meng Too at [Design+Code.](https://designcode.io/) I find his courses easy to follow since he has a design background and most of the chapters is about building things that actually work.

Gatsby its a popular boilerplate, it gives you a great start when you want to build web. I used a template for this site that gives me a CMS straight away. 

Then I just wrote all of the frontend in React. Since its mostly styled with CSS and I used components it went rather fast, using the simple principle of Atomic Design. What took the most time was configuring the components to display the different GraphQL fields I needed.

For building and deploying I used Netlify. Its super simple to hook up your Github repo and you can build both master and branches. As a last step I configured my DNS settings for the domain so it pointed towards Netlify.

Thats it, three resources I found incredibly useful. Thanks a lot [Oscar Hillestad](https://github.com/Poggen) and [Prakash](https://github.com/prakashdraws) whom helped me out when I got stuck :)
