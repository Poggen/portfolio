title: Principles for minimising cognitive load in design
description: Design
---
We humans have a limited span of attention so making your design easy to use is important if you want happy users. Easy to use design can be many things so in this post I'd like to focus on cognitive load.

Cognitive load is the mental processing power needed to use for example a site. High cognitive load means design that demands much brain power and the user will probably not finish tasks. Low cognitive load means design that demands little brain power and the user will probably finish tasks. 

When I design I like to think of three simple principles for less cognitive load. 



1/ Remove distractions

Remove visual things that slow the user down. So less modals asking for permission, not relevant links, images not related taking over, CTA-bars etc.



2/ Re-use existing patterns

Use well established patterns for information hierarchy and navigation. Don't re-invent patterns, assume the user has knowledge of the most common ones and design around them. No surprises.



3/ Less steps

For completing a task just use the bare minimum of steps. Can this signup be two steps instead of four? Great! Can we remove some fields that is not relevant? Also great!
