### What is cognitive load

When we visit a site there is things for our brain to learn. For example where buttons, text and images are located. Also what kind of information is presented and how much is relevant. These are all things we need to learn and keep in our brains [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory). The effort it takes to learn all of these things is [cognitive load.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load)

<br />

### Why it should be minimised

We usually have a misson when we visit a site and it's usually to complete a task. By trying to minimise cognitive load we make it easier to complete tasks. To completely remove cognitive load in user interface design is probably not possible, even just a black screen with one button will generate some cognitive load.

<br />

### Useful design principles

Here's a few design principles I use as a checklist for minimising cognitive load. It's not a one stop solution but I think they are a good start.

<br />

#### Remove distractions

Remove visual obstacles that slow the user down. Things that doesn't help the user complete a task should probably be left out. Avoid having several things calling for attention at the same time like images, buttons and modals. And does the chatbot really need be sticky in the right corner?

<br />

#### Re-use existing patterns

Use well established patterns for information hierarchy and navigation. Don't re-invent patterns, assume the user has knowledge of the most common ones and design around them. Unexpected navigation patterns lead to confusion.

<br />

#### Guide the user

Lead the user with clear visual cues. On a landing page use one primary CTA for example "Signup" and one secondary CTA for example "Login". Use contextual onboarding to highlight new features, good example is the one for [Chromecast.](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/design_checklist/cast-button#prompting) Few users read onboarding slides.

<br />

#### Increase readability

Aim for text to be easy to read instead of pretty. Internet is full of easy to read fonts, pick one of them instead of one that looks visually aesthetic. Bump up the font size and use a type system like [Materials Designs](https://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html#type-scale) to make it scale easily. Avoid text on images, even if you use a gradient chances are it's unnecessary hard to read.

<br />

#### Less choices

Give the user the bare minimum of choices in order to complete a task. When a user gets too many choices the cognitive load goes up and the brain slows down to handle all of the information. User gets frustrated not being able to complete the task. So keep choices down and make the ones available relevant in order to complete task.

These principles has helped me when designing, I hope you find them useful too.
