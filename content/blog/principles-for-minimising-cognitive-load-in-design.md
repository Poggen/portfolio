title: Principles for minimising cognitive load in design
description: Design
---
We humans have a limited span of attention so making your design easy to use is important if you want happy users. Easy to use design can be many things so in this post I'd like to focus in cognitive load.

Cognitive load is the mental processing power needed to use for example a site. High cognitive load means design that demands much brain power and the user will probably not finish tasks. Low cognitive load means design that demands little brain power and the user will probably finish tasks. 

When I design I like to think of three simple principles for less cognitive load. 

1/ Remove clutter

2/ Re-use existing patterns

3/ Less steps
