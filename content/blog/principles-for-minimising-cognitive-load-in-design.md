### What is cognitive load

When we design product and services we design it for us humans. Our brains have a limited span of attention and a limited capacity to process new information. The opposite is a computer with almost endless capabilities. 

Our ability to use for example a site is slowed down if there's a lot of information to be processed and navigation is hard to figure out. And we get frustrated and leave the site when we can't complete a task or find what we are looking for.

Cognitive load is how much mental capacity is needed to use that site and in the example above the cognitive load was high. Sites with low cognitive load is usually easy to navigate and completing tasks doesn't demand much thinking. Most things we use without thinking like a microwave has a low cognitive load. <br />

### Three tips for minimising cognitive load

Lorem ipsum about the tips

#### Remove distractions

Remove visual obstacles that slow the user down. Less modals asking for permission, not relevant links, none related images, CTA-bars etc. Just show the bare minimum a user needs to complete a task.<br />

#### Re-use existing patterns

Use well established patterns for information hierarchy and navigation. Don't re-invent patterns, assume the user has knowledge of the most common ones and design around them. Unexpected patterns lead to confusion.<br />

#### Guide the user

Lead the user with clear visual cues. On a landing page just use one primary CTA for example signup and one secondary CTA for example signup.
<br />

Following these three simple tips makes users think less. And when a user has to think less it's easier for them to complete their goal. And if its easy to complete goals then users tend to be happy. And everybody likes happy users.
