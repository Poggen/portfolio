### What is cognitive load

When we visit a site there's a lot of things for our brain to learn in order to successfully complete what we set out to do. Like where buttons, text and images are located. What kind of information is presented and how much of it that is relevant. These are all things we need to learn and keep in our brains working memory. The effort it takes to learn all of these things is cognitive load.

<br />

### Why it should be minimised

Users have a misson when they visit a site and it's usually to complete a task. By trying to minimise cognitive load we make it easier for users to complete their task. To completely remove cognitive load in user interface design is probably not possible, even just a black screen with one button will generate cognitive load.

### How to minimise cognitive load

Lorem ipsum about the tips

<br />

#### Remove distractions

Remove visual obstacles that slow the user down. Less modals asking for permission, not relevant links, none related images, CTA-bars etc. Just show the bare minimum a user needs to complete a task.

<br />

#### Re-use existing patterns

Use well established patterns for information hierarchy and navigation. Don't re-invent patterns, assume the user has knowledge of the most common ones and design around them. Unexpected patterns lead to confusion.

<br />

#### Guide the user

Lead the user with clear visual cues. On a landing page just use one primary CTA for example signup and one secondary CTA for example signup.

Following these three simple tips makes users think less. And when a user has to think less it's easier for them to complete their goal. And if its easy to complete goals then users tend to be happy. And everybody likes happy users.
