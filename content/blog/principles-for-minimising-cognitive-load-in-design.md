title: Principles for minimising cognitive load in design
description: Design
---
When we design product and services we design it for us humans. Our brains have a limited span of attention and a limited capacity to process new information. The opposite is a computer with almost endless capabilities. 

Our ability to use for example a site is slowed down if there's a lot of information to be processed and navigation is hard to figure out. And we get frustrated and leave the site when we can't complete a task or find what we are looking for.

Cognitive load is how much mental capacity is needed to use that site and in the example above the cognitive load was high. Sites with low cognitive load is usually easy to navigate for the user and completing tasks doesn't demand much thinking of the user. Most things we use without thinking like a microwave comes with a low cognitive load. 

As a designer I'm not an expert in human brains, even though I wish I was. But I do know some limits and can design solutions that accommodates most users capabilities.

So here's three simple principles how to minimise cognitive load in design.



**1/ Remove distractions**

Remove visual obstacles that slow the user down. Less modals asking for permission, not relevant links, none related images, CTA-bars etc. Just show the bare minimum a user needs to complete a task.



**2/ Re-use existing patterns**

Use well established patterns for information hierarchy and navigation. Don't re-invent patterns, assume the user has knowledge of the most common ones and design around them. Unexpected patterns lead to confusion.



**3/ Guide the user**

Contextual onboarding is a great example, highlight where the function is located in the app so the user can find it straight away.
