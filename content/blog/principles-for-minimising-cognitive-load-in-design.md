### What is cognitive load

When we visit a site there's a lot of things for our brain to learn in order to successfully complete what we set out to do. Like where buttons, text and images are located. What kind of information is presented and how much of it that is relevant. These are all things we need to learn and keep in our brains working memory. The effort it takes to learn all of these things is cognitive load.

<br />

### Why it should be minimised

Users have a misson when they visit a site and it's usually to complete a task. By trying to minimise cognitive load we make it easier for users to complete their task. To completely remove cognitive load in user interface design is probably not possible, even just a black screen with one button will generate cognitive load.

<br />

### Useful design principles

I've tried to summarise principles to use for minimising cognitive load in user interface design. It's easy to use as checklist.

<br />

#### Remove distractions

Remove visual obstacles that slow the user down. Things that doesn't help the user complete tasks should be added with care. Images should communicate what text says, buttons lead to logical places and modals asking for permissions should be kept at a bare minimum. And does the chatbot really need be sticky in the right corner?

<br />

#### Re-use existing patterns

Use well established patterns for information hierarchy and navigation. Don't re-invent patterns, assume the user has knowledge of the most common ones and design around them. Unexpected patterns lead to confusion.

<br />

#### Guide the user

Lead the user with clear visual cues. On a landing page just use one primary CTA for example "Signup" and one secondary CTA for example "Login". If needed use contextual onboarding to highlight new features, great example is the one for [Chromecast.](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/design_checklist/cast-button#prompting) 

<br />

#### Increase readability

Aim for text to be easy to read. Internet is full of easy to read fonts, pick one of them instead of one that looks visually ascetic. Bump up the font size and use a type system like [Materials Designs](https://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html#type-scale) to make it scale easily. Avoid text on images, even if you use a gradient chances are it's unnecessary hard to read.

That's three principles for minimising cognitive load. I hope you find them useful!
